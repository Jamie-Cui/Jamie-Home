开了许多新坑一没有时间去填，预计在19号写完IRR的Draft之后可以继续更新博客了。

接下来会更新一系列youtube上的教学视频争取把内容可以转换成文字易于读取的形式，目前要更新的是[合理的入侵：黑客从零开始][hacker-url]（谨慎打开，需要翻墙）

# **常见的定义**

`黑帽`：我们日常认知的黑客 illegal

`白帽`：入侵测试人员 legal

`灰帽`：游走在犯法的边缘

`Footprinting`: general information gathering on your target, it doesn't has to be on the digital world

`Dos`: just you --- childish way

`DDos`: multiple people --- difficult to fight against (physical defenses --- router firewall) not difficult to carry attack, difficult to do the preparations. --- compromise other computers to carry out ddos attack --- FUD and RAT

`FUD`: fully undetectable (anti-virus cannot detect)

`RAT`: remote administration tools --- email\usb to gain root on their computer, slave their computer, user has no idea what is going on with their computer, because it performs normally, everything running in the background. 

`Rootkit`: installed on the OS --- hid the process from task manager --- redirect the message from task manager to itself

`Fishing`: email \ url link --- today --- dns sever was changed, you are redirected to malicious website --- get confidential information

`SQL Injection`: learned before

`VPN` `Proxy` 

`Tor` --- stay anonymous
